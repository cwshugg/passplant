# Passwords should probably be like snowflakes...
No two are alike! (unless of course, you're using this generator and you happen to get the same exact password with the same length, words, symbols, and numbers... not super likely, though.)

# What is this?
Your personal password generator! This is a quick side project I whipped up. The idea is to create passwords that are both secure and memorable, not just a long string of digits and letters. My plan is to have it pull most of its words from random word banks.

In some cases, though, I plan on having the program ask the user a question every once in a while (i.e. "What's your favorite color?"). It'll log your response and you might see that word in a password every now and then.

# Why make it?
I'm not the best at giving my passwords variety, and while I've certainly tried to use the various services out there that store and save your passwords, I never really liked the passwords they recommended (something like: djz5214Jwhy23_31!?@az). Instead, I'd much rather prefer a password just as long, but something a little more memorable (like the well-known "correctHorseBatteryStaple" thanks to xkcd: https://xkcd.com/936/).

Thus, I decided to write a small password generator that asks you a few questions and uses your personal preferences to generate something long, secure, and most importantly, interesting.

CREDIT WHERE IT'S DUE:
I found a great public repo containing lots of commonly-used english words. I've used some of these to generate most words in the generator. Here it is:
