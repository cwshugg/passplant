# passplant
Your personal password generator.

# What?
This is a personal project I thought to create. The idea is to create passwords that are both secure and memorable, not just a long string of digits and letters.

# Why?
I'm not the best at giving my passwords variety, and while I've certainly tried to use the various services out there that store and save your passwords, I never really liked the passwords they recommended (something like: djz5214Jwhy23_31!?@az). Instead, I'd much rather prefer a password just as long, but something a little more memorable (like the well-known "correctHorseBatteryStaple" thanks to xkcd: https://xkcd.com/936/). Thus, I decided to write a small password generator that asks you a few questions to generate something long, secure, and most importantly, interesting.
